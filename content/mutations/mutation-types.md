# Mutation Types

As we saw in the previous section, Relay employs a client-side cache.
Whenever we are sending a mutation to the server, Relay needs to know how to update this cache with the mutation query result.
We have to add mutation types to the array `getConfigs` for a mutation to configure this behaviour.

Oftentimes we will only use one of the types for one mutation, but we can combine multiple mutation types for the same mutation as well.

## RANGE_ADD

If a mutation is creating a new node, we can use `RANGE_ADD`:

```javascript
getConfigs () {
  return [{
    type: 'RANGE_ADD',
    parentName: 'viewer',
    parentID: this.props.viewer.id,
    connectionName: 'allPokemons',
    edgeName: 'edge',
    rangeBehaviors: {
      '': 'append',
    },
  }]
}
```

We set `parentName` to `viewer`, `connectionName` to `allPokemons` and `edgeName` to `edge`.
Check the `CreatePokemonPayload` of the `createPokemonMutation` in the docs of our GraphQL backend inside GraphiQL to find the exact names you have to use.

The `append` inside `rangeBehaviors` means that we are appending the new edge to the present edges of `allPokemons`.
If we used `prepend`, we could prepend the edge instead.

Note that most of the time it is sufficient to only use one key `''` inside `rangeBehaviors`.
If you need different behaviour depending on some other value of the connection, you can add different keys and define different behaviour.

## FIELDS_CHANGE

To update an existing node of type `Pokemon`, we can use `FIELDS_CHANGE`:

```javascript
getConfigs () {
  return [{
    type: 'FIELDS_CHANGE',
    fieldIDs: {
      pokemon: this.props.pokemonId,
    },
  }]
}
```

We set `pokemon` in `fieldIDs` to `this.props.pokemonId`. This way we say that the node `pokemon` in the mutation query response denotes the data item in the Relay cache with id `this.props.pokemonId`.

Check the `UpdatePokemonPayload` of the `updatePokemonMutation` to find the exact names you have to use.

> Note that this type can be used for more than just updates. For example, we could make Relay aware of the creation of a node with FIELDS_CHANGE, just like with RANGE_ADD. Specifying that will most of the times be easier with FIELDS_CHANGE, but will also be less performant.

## NODE_DELETE

To delete an existing node of type `Pokemon`, we can use `NODE_DELETE`:

```javascript
getConfigs () {
  return [{
    type: 'NODE_DELETE',
    parentName: 'viewer',
    parentID: this.props.viewerId,
    connectionName: 'pokemon',
    deletedIDFieldName: 'deletedId',
  }]
}
```

We set `parentName` to `viewer`, `connectionName` to `pokemon` and `edgeName` to `edge`.

Note that we could use `allPokemons` for the `connectionName` to achieve a similar result.
Check the `DeletePokemonPayload` of the `deletePokemonMutation` to find the exact names you have to use.

## RANGE_DELETE

To remove one or more existing edges between two nodes, we can use `RANGE_DELETE`:

```javascript
getConfigs() {
  return [{
    type: 'RANGE_DELETE',
    parentName: 'pokemon',
    parentID: this.props.pokemon.id,
    connectionName: 'similarPokemons',
    deletedIDFieldName: 'deletedIds',
  }];
}
```

This will effectively remove all nodes included by id in `deletedIds` from the `similarPokemons` connection of the specified `pokemon`, but the nodes themselves will still be present. This is only really useful for nested fields, that's why we included a fictitious edge `similarPokemons` that could contain all Pokemons that are similar to a specific one.

Note that this mutation type is not required for our Pokedex app.

## REQUIRED_CHILDREN

To query fields on a newly created that are not reachable by an edge you can use `REQUIRED_CHILDREN`:

```javascript
getConfigs() {
  return [{
    type: 'REQUIRED_CHILDREN',
    children: [Relay.QL`
      fragment on AddThingPayload {
        someField
      }
    `],
  }];
}
```

This will make the object `addThing` available in the `onSuccess` callback of the mutation, but will **not** write the changes to the store.
This type can be used to redirect to a view that depends on a newly created node once it's created.

Note that this type is rarely used and is only applicable in very specific use cases.

## Exercise 06: Delete a Pokemon

> To start with this exercise, checkout the according branch and insert your endpoint in `package.json` and `index.js` in the pokedex application:

```sh
git checkout step-06
# copy and paste your endpoint to `package.json` and index.js
npm install
npm start
# Open localhost:3000
```

In every Pokemon's life, there comes a point where it has to go into its well deserved retirement. That's why we should add a delete feature to the `PokemonPage`!

We now have the required knowledge to do so. In the branch `step-6`, we already prepared the foundation of a new `DeletePokemonMutation`. Check the list above and choose the correct mutation type to delete a single Pokemon from your Pokedex once and for all! No return back from retirement...

Once you finished creating the mutation, make sure to fire it properly when the delete button is clicked on the `PokemonPage`!

In summary you should

* fill the new mutation `DeletePokemonMutation` with life
* fire the `DeletePokemonMutation` when the delete button on the `PokemonPage` is clicked
